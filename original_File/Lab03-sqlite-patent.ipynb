    "In this assignment, we're going to solve a problem for which you'll also see the solution in Hadoop and then implement a PySpark solution. We have two databases\n",
    "* One contains information about patents\n",
    "* One contains information about patent citations (one patent citing the work of another)\n",
    "The problem we're going to solve is augmenting the original patent data to include the number of *co-state citations*. In other words, if patent X was issued to someone in Colorado and patent Y was also issued to someone in Colorado and X cites Y, then this is a co-state citation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to solve this is to build an intermediary product from the patent citations table. That table contains `CITING` and `CITED` columns; you would augment it by adding `CITING_STATE` and `CITED_STATE`. Then, it becomes fairly simple to filter out all the cases where those states don't match. You can then use an sql `GROUP BY` to `COUNT(*)` all the co-state citations for a given patent and then join that with the original patents table resulting in an augmented table.\n",

We're assuming you've learned some SQL in a previous life and if not, [now is a great time to learn](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/). Even if you've done basic SQL, you'll probably need to review [using `select` in a where-clause or using multiple joins](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/33553/using-select-in-the-where-clause-of-another-select).\n"
